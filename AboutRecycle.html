            The creation of this outlet was to give people a more accesible
            way of recycling in this local area. The year of 2020 has created a lot of rift
            that has affected so many. This is a way that we can all come together as a community, 
            and keep everyone safe, and happy. Amongst those things to keep our planet going along 
            with us is taking time to recycle. Keep it clean in 2020, and green, and take time to 
            recycle please.
